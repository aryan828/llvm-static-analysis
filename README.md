# LLVM IR ANALYSIS

LLVM provides passes to perform analsis or tansformation on LLVM IR. These passes can be used to improve the performance of the code or to analyze the code for bottlenecks.

There are three types of passes in LLVM:
- Analysis Passes
- Transformation Passes
- Utility Passes

This repository contains a few examples of analysis passes.
